# Splunk>Phantom

Welcome to the Splunk>Phantom Community! Phantom is Splunk's premier Security Automation, Orchestration, and Response ("SOAR") platform. With it, our customers can automation entire or partial workflows for their employees across an infinite number of use-cases. 

This repository represents our efforts to open-source our Phantom Apps so our customers can look at how our code works, make improvements, and generally build a stronger community through the free exchange of ideas.

## Reporting Issues
If you've found a problem but don't want to contribute a fix, that's ok! All you need to do is go to the `Issues` section of the Repo and click 'New Issue'. This will show our conviniently set-up Issue templates. 

![Issues Templates](.github/Images/Github-Issue-Templates.png)

All you have to do is fill out the form...

![Bug Report](.github/Images/Github-Bug-Template.png) 

...and it'll get reviewed and priortized by our developers and maybe even someone in our community.

Of course before you do this, you should definitely check if there is already an open issue and if so, add a thumbs-up reaction to it so we can get a sense of how to prioritize it.
