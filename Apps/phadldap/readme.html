    <p><h2>App Information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>This LDAP application utilizes the LDAP3 library for Python. This was chosen, in part, due to the pythonic design of the library
            and the quality of the documentation. Both SSL and TLS are supported.</li>
          <li>Please make sure to view additional documentation for this app on our <a href="https://github.com/phantomcyber/phantom-apps/tree/next/Apps/phadldap#readme">GitHub Open Source Repo!</a> </li>
        </ul>

    <p><h2>LDAP Ports Requirements (Based on Standard Guidelines of <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml" target="_blank">IANA ORG</a>)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>LDAP(service) TCP(transport protocol) - 389</li>
        <li>LDAP(service) UDP(transport protocol) - 389</li>
        <li>LDAP(service) TCP(transport protocol) over TLS/SSL (was sldap) - 636</li>
        <li>LDAP(service) UDP(transport protocol) over TLS/SSL (was sldap) - 636</li>
      </ul>

    <p><h2>Asset Configuration</h2>

      The asset for this app requires an account with which to Bind and perform actions. If you are only ever going to perform information gathering tasks
      (e.g. getting account attributes) then a standard user account would be fine. However, if you plan on doing things like Unlocking,
      Resetting Passwords, Moving objects, etc. - then you will need an account with permissions to actually perform these actions.
      It is best practice to NOT use a "Domain Administrator" (or higher) account. Instead, delegate the appropriate least-privilege access
      to a service account with a very strong password. Lastly, it is strongly recommended to use SSL and disallow insecure (plain text and unsigned binds)
      if at all possible.

    <p><h2>Run Query Action</h2>
      This action provides the user the ability to run generic queries with the LDAP syntax. The action takes a filter (in LDAP syntax), an optional
      search base to search within, and specific attributes that you would like to return.
      <ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Get Users belonging to a specific OU, Container, or Group</li>
            <ul>
              <li>filter = (samaccountname=*)</li>
              <li>attributes = samaccountname;mail</li>
              <li>search_base = distinguishedNameOfOU/Container/Group</li>
            </ul>
            <li>List Group Names that a User belongs to</li>
            <ul>
              <li>filter = (&(member=distinguishedNameOfUserHERE)(objectClass=group))</li>
              <li>attributes = name</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Return results if mail attribute is present OR sAMAccountName matches '*admin*'</li>
            <ul>
              <li>filter = (|(mail=*)(samaccountname=*admin*))</li>
              <li>attributes = samaccountname;mail;userprincipalname;distinguishedname</li>
            </ul>
