  <p>
    The asset settings page has several ingestions related settings.

    This app is currently written to support the ingestion of either the Cofense Triage Threat Indicators or the Cofense
    Triage Reports.

    This is set by the <b> ingestion_method </b> variable by a pull-down menu.

    If you wish to ingest both sets of data, it is suggested you set up a second Cofense Triage asset with the same
    credentials,
    but with the variable set to the other value.

      <td>max_results</td>
      <td>Maximum number of results retrieved during the ingestion run.</td>
      <td>This is adjustable to any number. The practical limit is dictated by the number of API calls that your rate
        limit allows. Each API call will retrieve the maximum allowed of 50 results.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>start_date</td>
      <td>The initial start date and time of the ingestion. The default is six days ago.</td>
      <td>This setting is used only if there weren't any prior successful ingestions and were ignored afterward. If
        left blank, it will default to the product setting of six days ago. If one or more results are successfully
        ingested, the relevant date of the last ingested result is used to set the start date for the next ingestion
        run. It is important to set this setting to date within a range that contains data.<br></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>date_sort</td>
      <td>Retrieve either the oldest results first or the latest results first.</td>
      <td>This setting is used to set which pages of results to retrieve and how they are sorted. This setting makes the
        observed assumption that the result ID is ordered by ascending date. ie. ID=1 is an older result than ID=2.
        If this setting is the <b>Oldest first</b> the results are retrieved and sorted with the lowest ID first. If the
        ingestion run of <b>max_results</b> does not completely exhaust this list of results, it will continue to
        retrieve the oldest entries until all the results are exhausted.
        If this setting is the <b>latest first</b> the results are retrieved and sorted with the highest ID first. We
        will ingest the newest results first and then work our way down to older results until we hit <b>max_results</b>
        or your rate limit.
        <i>If older results remaining in the ingestion run, they will be ignored on the next ingestion run.</i>
        This will always guarantee your latest results are ingested first at the risk of losing older results if it
        exceeds your <b>max_result</b> or rate limit.

        json.dumps(). Each key in the dictionary is a potential key name in an artifact that is to be renamed to the
        value. For example, if the cef_mapping is {"website": "requestURL"} your artifact will have requestURL cef

    <b>NOTE</b>: The Triage devices fetch data according to their own rules. If you look carefully at the logs or the
    output of the poll-now,
    you may see the last result from the previous ingestion, reingested and marked as a duplicate container. This is to
    guarantee we do not miss any
    results since the last ingestion.
