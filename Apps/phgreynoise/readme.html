    <h2>Playbook Backward Compatibility</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>The new version of this application is a complete rewrite and is not backward compatible. Hence, it is requested to the end-user to please update their existing playbooks by re-inserting | modifying | deleting the corresponding action blocks to ensure the correct functioning of the playbooks created on the earlier versions of the app. If the end-user does not want to upgrade their playbooks, they can remain on or downgrade to the old version(v1.0.0).</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The GreyNoise Enrichment plugin for Phantom enriches observables to identify activity associated with
      mass-internet scanning, creating more time to investigate other higher priority observables.
      This enrichment provides context into IP behavior: intent, tags, first seen,
      last seen, geo-data, ports, OS, and JA3. <br><br>The GreyNoise Enrichment plugin for Phantom requires an API key.
      Set up an account to receive an API key and find GreyNoise documentation here:

    <h2>Actions</h2>
  
    <h4>lookup ip</h4>
    <p>Check to see if a given IP has been seen by GreyNoise engaging in internet scanning behavior.</p>
  
    <h4>lookup ips</h4>
    <p>Check whether IP addresses in a set have been seen engaging in internet scanning behavior.
      This action is similar to <i>lookup ip</i> except that it processes more than one IP at a time. IPs should be comma-separated.</p>
  
    <h4>ip reputation</h4>
    <p>Delivers full IP context: time ranges, IP metadata
      (network owner, ASN, reverse DNS pointer, country), associated actors, activity tags,
      and raw port scan and web request information.</p>
  
    <h4>gnql query</h4>
    <p>GreyNoise Query Language (GNQL) uses Lucene deep under the hood.
      GNQL enables users to make complex and one-off queries against the GreyNoise dataset. <br>For more information, please visit:
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developer.greynoise.io/reference#gnqlquery-1">https://developer.greynoise.io/reference#gnqlquery-1</a></p>
  
    <h4>on poll</h4>
    <p>Retrieves GNQL query results on a set interval. The default number of results returned is 25.
    <br>
  
    Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>The on poll action will spawn a container for each result returned. Phantom performance may be degraded if an overly large query is used.
      <li>Potentially useful queries may include ones that limit results to assets owned by your organization, such as:
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            metadata.organization:your_organization classification:malicious
          </li>
          <li>
            8.8.8.0/30 (replace with your address block) classification:malicious
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>To test your query or to learn more about GNQL queries, please visit <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developer.greynoise.io/reference#gnqlquery-1">https://developer.greynoise.io/reference#gnqlquery-1</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>test connectivity</h4>
    <p>Test connectivity to GreyNoise. Requires a valid API key.</p>
