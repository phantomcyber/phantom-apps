# Splunk SOAR App

## Introduction

The Splunk SOAR App for ThreatQ allows a user to execute a variety of actions on ThreatQ from a Phantom playbook. 
With ThreatQ as a single source of truth for Threat Intelligence, you will be able to accurately triage a sighting, and ultimately, make a quick decision. 
This will allow your analysts to focus on what's important to their organization, instead of getting inundated with sightings of non-malicious indicators. 
The goal being, to increase your response time and improve your ROI.

## Installation

This section will describe how you can install the app into your Phantom instance

**WARNING**: This release (v2.x) has fundamentally changed how the App operates! 
If you are upgrading from v1.x, please refer to the `App Instructions -> Upgrading from 1.x to 2.x` section!
Splunk SOAR App works just on python 2

## App Instructions

### Formatting an Indicator List

You can pass a list of indicators to an action in few different ways. Each being parsed, slightly differently, but with similar outcomes

- If only values are specified, the integration will attempt to "detect" the indicator types and upload the known values (i.e. `1.1.1.1, badurl.com`)
- You can specify indicator types by separating the type and value by a `:` or `=` character (i.e. `IP Address: 1.1.1.1, FQDN: badurl.com`)
- You can even pass the function a list of dictionaries, specifying the indicator type and value, like so:
```json
[
    {
        "type": "IP Address",
        "value": "1.1.1.1"
    },
    {
        "type": "FQDN",
        "value": "badurl.com"
    }
]
```

### Upgrading from 1.x to 2.x

While many of the actions in v2.x of the Phantom App look very similar to the v1.x App, they operate very differently. Chances are, you will need to recreate all of the ThreatQ App actions, and reconfigure them. Please review all of the actions under the `App Actions` section to see how to configure them.
