    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>This app was created in response to a marked increase in work from home employees, which has inevitably led to a significant rise in Zoom usage. This app provides important additional context about meetings (e.g., was the meeting password protected, was the waiting room turned on). This app provides security practitioners a way to ensure that security best practices are being followed with regard to Zoom meetings.</p>

    <h3>App Configurations (Zoom Side)</h3>
    <p>For the Zoom app for Phantom to be configured correctly, you must first create a JWT App in your Zoom App Marketplace account. A JWT App can be created by going <a href="https://marketplace.zoom.us/develop/create">here</a> and clicking the "Create" button under the "JWT" app type. Once you've created your JWT app you'll be provided with an API Key and an API Secret, keep track of these. They will be necessary for the configuration on the Phantom side.</p>

    <h3>App Configuration (Splunk> Phantom Side)</h3>
    <p>The configuration of the Zoom App for Splunk> Phantom requires three fields API Key and API Secret which are provided by Zoom. The third field is the "Base URL" field which is simply the base URL for the Zoom REST API. The default value provided, "https://api.zoom/us/v2" should not need to be changed.

    <h3>Actions</h3>
    <p>Actions are all fairly simple and documented with the normal app documentation process. That said, one of the main purposes of this app was to provide additional context about meetings that can only be provided via the Zoom API, most notably whether or not the meetings are being password protected.</p>

    <p>The two actions that provide information on the configuration of passwords on meetings are "get meeting" and "get meeting invitation". These two actions will give you data that can be used to gain insight into who is running unprotected meetings, how often, and what are the topics of those meetings.</p>
