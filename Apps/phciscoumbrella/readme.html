<p>This app implements actions that manage an Cisco Umbrella domain list. Cisco allows third party implementations like Phantom Enterprise to create and manage a list of domains (i.e. add, delete) via what it calls 'custom integrations'. The Phantom Cisco Umbrella App requires such an integration to be pre-configured on Cisco Umbrella. The steps to do this are outlined below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Login to your Cisco dashboard and go to Policies &gt; Policy Components &gt; Integrations and click the &quot;add&quot; button.</li>
<li>Set the name of the custom integration to be &quot;Phantom Orchestration Feed&quot;</li>
<li>Expand your new custom integration, check &quot;Enable&quot;, copy the integration URL and then click Save.</li>
<li>The integration URL will be of the form: <b>https://s-platform.api.opendns.com/1.0/events?customerKey=bac2bfa7-d134-4b85-a5ed-b1ffec027a91</b> One of the parameters to this URL is the customer key (GUID format). This value will be required while configuring the Cisco Umbrella asset on Phantom. The Cisco Umbrella App on Phantom will use this customer key while adding, listing and deleting domains.</li>
<li>Go to Policies &gt; Policy Components &gt; Security Settings, click on add and check the relevant security settings. Scroll down and under Integrations select 'Phantom Orchestration Feed'.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the above steps Cisco Umbrella has been configured to:<br> 
<ul>
  <li>Create a 'custom integration' domain list with a <em>customerKey</em> for Phantom to use.</li>
  <li>Use the domains belonging to the 'Phantom Orchestration Feed' to block DNS requests.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Next step is to configure an 'Cisco Umbrella' asset on Phantom and specify the 'customerKey' and hit 'Test Connectivity' to validate the configuration.</p>
