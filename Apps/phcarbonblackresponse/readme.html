<p>Every action uses the <b>api_token</b> configured on the Carbon Black Response asset. This token represents a user on the Carbon Black Response server. Many actions like <b>list endpoints</b> require the user to have permissions to be able to view sensors. The Carbon Black Response user that Phantom uses must have the privileges needed to perform the actions being attempted. For example, to quarantine endpoints, the account used by Phantom must have Carbon Black Response administrator privileges.</p>
