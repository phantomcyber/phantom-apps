<h2>Playbook Backward Compatibility</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The newer version of the app updates the action names for blacklist and whitelist actions. Hence, it is requested to
      the end-user to please update their existing playbooks by modifying the corresponding action blocks to ensure the
      correct functioning of the playbooks created on the earlier versions of the app. The following actions names have been
      updated:
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>[blacklist url] to [blocklist url]</li>
      <li>[unblacklist url] to [unblocklist url]</li>
      <li>[whitelist url] to [allowlist url]</li>
      <li>[unwhitelist url] to [unallowlist url]</li>
      <li>[blacklist sender] to [blocklist sender]</li>
      <li>[whitelist sender] to [allowlist sender]</li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      Added new paremeter in the action given below. Hence, it is requested to the end-user to please update their existing playbooks by re-inserting | modifying | deleting the corresponding action blocks or by providing appropriate values to these action parameters to ensure the correct functioning of the playbooks created on the earlier versions of the app.
      <ul>
        <li>list urls - 'max_results' parameter has been added</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Authorization</h2>

Upon installing Mimecast and configuring your asset, you will not have an accessKey or secretKey (together known as a
binding) that is required by Mimecast upon each call to its API.<br></br>
When you run the first Mimecast action or test connectivity on the asset, your accessKey and secretKey will be generated
and saved in your instance.<br></br>
Every action run will be using the same accessKey and secretKey that was saved to avoid generating new keys on every
request.<br></br>

It is important to note that your accessKey and secretKey binding may expire after the period of time defined in the
Authentication Cache TTL setting in the service user's effective Authentication Profile (accessible through the Mimecast
Administration Console under Services>Applications>Authentication Profiles). It is recommended to set this to "Never
Expires" so you do not have to deal with expired authentication.

<h2>Points to remember while connecting to Mimecast</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>IP Range Restrictions:</b> Be sure to enable your Mimecast to accept communication with the IP address of your
    Phantom server(s).</li>
  <li><b>Two Factor Authentication:</b> Mimecast supports optional two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication
    should be disabled for the account
    that is used to handle API communication with Phantom.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <b>Note:</b>
  The 'unblocklist url' and 'unallowlist url' actions use the same API endpoint and action parameter to remove the URL from the
  blocklist and allowlist. Hence, removing the URL from the allowlist will automatically remove the URL from the
  blocklist as well.
