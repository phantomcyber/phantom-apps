<b>Authorization</b><br></br>

Upon installing Mimecast and configuring your asset, you will not have an accessKey or secretKey (together known as a binding) that is required by Mimecast upon each call to its API.<br></br>
When you run the first Mimecast action or test connectivity on the asset, your accessKey and secretKey will be generated and saved in your instance.<br></br>
Every action run will be using the same accessKey and secretKey that was saved in order to avoid generating new keys on every request.<br></br>

It is important to note that your accessKey and secretKey binding may expire after the period of time defined in the Authentication Cache TTL setting in the service user's effective Authentication Profile (accessible through the Mimecast Administration Console under Services>Applications>Authentication Profiles). It is recommended to set this to "Never Expires" so you do not have to deal with expired authentication.<br></br>

In the event that you do want your authentication binding to expire after a specified time, the first failed action using the expired binding will make the Mimecast app automatically reset your accessKey and secretKey. Simply run the failed action once again and it should now be authorized with a new binding.
