<p>The app uses the tldextract python module while executing the 'whois domain' action. This module uses the tld list from publicsuffix.org. The app ships with a tld list, however, it will try to update the list the first time it runs and then tries to update it at a regular interval. The interval is set in the app config.</p>
<p>This app will ignore the HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables.</p>
