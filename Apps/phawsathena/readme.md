## Asset Configuration

There are two ways to configure an AWS Athena asset. The first is to configure the **access_key** ,
**secret_key** and **region** variables. If it is preferred to use a role and Phantom is running as
an EC2 instance, the **use_role** checkbox can be checked instead. This will allow the role that is
attached to the instance to be used. Please see the [AWS EC2 and IAM
documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html)
for more information.  
  
This app also requires some integration with AWS S3. Query results will be stored in a folder on S3
specified during a query action. These results can be encrypted using various encryption schemes,
some of which require a KMS key. This KMS key should be provided when configuring the asset and must
be applicable for the given region.

## Assumed Role Credentials

The optional **credentials** action parameter consists of temporary **assumed role** credentials
that will be used to perform the action instead of those that are configured in the **asset** . The
parameter is not designed to be configured manually, but should instead be used in conjunction with
the Phantom AWS Security Token Service app. The output of the **assume_role** action of the STS app
with data path **assume_role\_\<number>:action_result.data.\*.Credentials** consists of a dictionary
containing the **AccessKeyId** , **SecretAccessKey** , **SessionToken** and **Expiration** key/value
pairs. This dictionary can be passed directly into the credentials parameter in any of the following
actions within a playbook. For more information, please see the [AWS Identity and Access Management
documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iam/index.html) .
