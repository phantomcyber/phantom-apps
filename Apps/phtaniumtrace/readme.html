        <h1>Tanium Threat Response Typical Usage Example</h1>
        <p>
            To get the information from Tanium Threat Response, you will need to follow a certain flow of actions
            to get what you want. First, you will need to run a search to find the computer that Threat Response can interact
            with. To get that you can run the <code>list computers</code> action to search through the computers that
            are connected to Threat Response. You will get back the top 10 computers that match a search query, so being as
            specific as possible would be better.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you find the computer that you want to collect information from, you need to create a connection using
            the <code>create connection</code> action, where the name returned from the <code>list computers</code> is used.
            Otherwise, the connection may take a while and fail. This action only sends the request to create the
            connection and will not return the status of that connection.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can then test to see if your connection was made by running <code>get connection</code>. It will list
            the status of all the current connections. An <b>active</b> status means you can run the other actions to
            get information that you may need. Live connections will timeout and need to be recreated in those cases.
            Connections to snapshots will stay open and should be closed after everything is completed.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can get the list of all the snapshots by running the <code>list snapshots</code> action. It will list all the
            snapshots, i.e., the snapshot files that are uploaded manually and the snapshots that are captured through Tanium UI.
            The <code>list local snapshots</code> action lists only those snapshots which are captured through Tanium UI. Also,
            the endpoint used in the <code>list local snapshots</code> action will be deprecated in the future so we would suggest
            you use the <code>list snapshots</code> action instead of the <code>list local snapshots</code> action.
        </p>
        <p>
            To delete a snapshot, you can run the <code>delete snapshot</code> action by providing the <b>host</b> and the
            <b>filename</b>. The <code>delete local snapshot</code> action does not work as per the expectation, as the status
            of the deleted snapshot does not get reflected on the UI. Hence, we would suggest you use the <code>delete
            snapshot</code> action instead of the <code>delete local snapshot</code> action.
