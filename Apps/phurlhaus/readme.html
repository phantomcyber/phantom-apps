  <body>This app is designed to gather open source cyber threat intelligence (OSINT) from Abuse.ch's well known "URLhaus" platform.
  	<br><br>The API is <a href="https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/api/">well documented</a>, so take a look. The app aims to use 'contains' and example values as often as possible, but certain capabilities have lots of settings which are documented here, but minimally.

  	<br><br>No API key is required for this app. Future iterations could leverage the API key for submissions.
