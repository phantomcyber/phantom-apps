This app is designed to gather open source cyber threat intelligence (OSINT) from Abuse.ch's well
known "URLhaus" platform.  
  
The API is [well documented](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/api/) , so take a look. The app aims to use
'contains' and example values as often as possible, but certain capabilities have lots of settings
which are documented here, but minimally.  
  
No API key is required for this app. Future iterations could leverage the API key for submissions.
