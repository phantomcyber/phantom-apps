    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The Cybereason platform finds a single component of an attack and connects it to other pieces of information to reveal an entire campaign and shut it down.
      There are two types of alerts that Cybereason will create:
      <ul>
        <li>Malops: This stands for a Malicious Operation, and will describe machines, users, processes, and connections used in the attack.</li>
        <li>Malware: These alerts are generated when a user tries to run a piece of malware.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Playbook Backward Compatibility</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>The new version of this application is a complete rewrite and is not backward compatible. Hence, it is requested to the end-user to please update their existing playbooks by re-inserting | modifying | deleting the corresponding action blocks to ensure the correct functioning of the playbooks created on the earlier versions of the app. If the end-user does not want to upgrade their playbooks, they can remain on or downgrade to the old version(v1.0.7).</li>
        </ul>
