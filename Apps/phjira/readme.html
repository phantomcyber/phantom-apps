<h2>JIRA</h2>

<p>JIRA is a highly configurable ticketing system, and the actions performed by these API calls are highly dependent on the process defined in each Jira instance.</p>

<p>If your action fails, you may need to try an alternate method, or sequence, to perform the actions desired for Jira to process them properly.
One helpful debugging tool: simplify your action, instead of filling out all the fields, attempt to make only one change at a time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the JIRA API in most cases returns a generic error message with no valuable information to assist in debugging.</p>

<p><b>Playbook Backward Compatibility</b>
	<ul>
		<li>The existing action parameters have been modified in the actions given below. Hence, it is requested to the end-user to please update their existing playbooks by re-inserting the corresponding action blocks or by providing appropriate values to these action parameters to ensure the correct functioning of the playbooks created on the earlier versions of the app.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Add Watcher - The new [user_account_id] parameter has been added for the Jira cloud to add a watcher into a provided issue.</li>
			<li>Remove Watcher - The new [user_account_id] parameter has been added for the Jira cloud to remove a watcher from a provided issue.</li>
			<li>Create Ticket - The new [assignee_account_id] parameter has been added for the Jira cloud to add the assignee while creating a Jira ticket.</li>
			<li>Lookup Users - Added a new action. This action will get a list of User resources that match the specified search string.</li>
			<li>Add Comment - The new [internal] parameter has been added for comment that whether it should be internal only or not in Jira Service Desk. This parameter is an optional Boolean parameter. If the value is not provided for it, then it will be considered as a 'False' value.</li>
			<li>Get Attachments - Added a new action. The action will store specific attachments from a given Jira ticket inside the vault.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</p>

	<b>Authentication steps for JIRA Cloud</b>
    <ul>
		<li>Create an API token</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Log in to <a href='https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens' target='_blank'>Click here.</a></li>
				<li>Click <b>Create an API token.</b></li>
				<li>From the dialog that appears, enter a unique and concise <b>Label</b> for your token and click <b>Create</b>.</li>
				<li>Click <b>Copy to clipboard</b>, then paste the token to your script, or elsewhere to save.</li>
				<br>
				Notes:
					<li>For security reasons it isn't possible to view the token after closing the creation dialog; if necessary, create a new token.</li>
					<li>You should store the token securely, just as for any password.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
		<li>Use an API token</li>
			<ul>
				<li>A primary use case for API tokens is to allow scripts to access REST APIs for Atlassian Cloud applications using HTTP basic authentication.</li>
				<li>HTTP basic authentication would require a username and API token to access REST APIs for Atlassian Cloud applications.
			</ul>
			<br>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	<b>The functioning of On Poll</b>
		<ul>
			<li><b>NOTE (Consider below points due to a minute's granularity (instead of a second or lesser) for querying tickets in the JIRA)</b></li>
				<ul>
					<li>It is highly recommended for configuring a significantly large value (larger than the number of existing tickets on the user's instance) in the <b></b> asset configuration parameter to bring the ingested tickets in the Phantom in sync entirely with the JIRA instance in the first run</li>
					<li>It is highly recommended for configuring a significantly large value (larger than the possible number of tickets that can be updated in 1 minute or any value larger than the average number of tickets getting created every unit of time (based on the frequency of scheduled or interval polling)) in the <b></b> asset configuration parameter to avoid the duplicate tickets ingestion</li>
				</ul>
			<br>
			<li>The On Poll action works in 2 steps. In the first step, all the tickets (issues) in a defined time duration will be fetched. In the second step, all the components (e.g. fields, comments, and attachments) of the tickets (retrieved in the first step) will be fetched. A container will be created for each ticket and for each ticket all the components will be created as the respective artifacts.</li>
			<li>The tickets will be fetched in the oldest first order based on the <b>updated</b> time in the On Poll action</li>
			<li>The updated timestamps of the components have been appended to the end of the artifact name to maintain the uniqueness of a particular component</li>
			<li>The timezone parameter in the asset configurations defines the timezone used to query the tickets from the JIRA instance. If you do not find your exact timezone in the available list in the dropdown, please select a timezone having the same time offset from the GMT timezone as yours. Below are the details of setting the timezone parameter for on-prem and cloud JIRA instances.</li>
			<ol>
				<li>On-premise JIRA</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The timezone parameter here is the profile timezone of the JIRA instance</li>
						<li>For checking the profile timezone, navigate to the JIRA instance; navigate to the profile settings; the value of the <b>Time Zone</b> parameter is the timezone that has to be provided in the Phantom asset configuration</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Cloud JIRA</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The timezone parameter here is the system settings timezone of the JIRA instance</li>
						<li>For checking the system settings timezone, navigate to the JIRA instance; navigate to the option <b>Jira Settings --> System</b> in the settings page; the value of the <b>Default user time zone</b> parameter is the timezone that has to be provided in the Phantom asset configuration</li>
					</ul>
			</ol>
			<li>Users can provide the JSON formatted list of names of the custom fields (to be considered for the ingestion) in the asset configuration parameter <b>custom_fields</b> e.g. ["Test \"CF\" 1", "test_cf_2"]. It's a valid JSON formatted list of strings, so the user should use escape sequences whenever needed. Please find the below points for getting exact names for the custom fields.</li>
			<ol>
				<li>On-premise JIRA</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Navigate to the JIRA instance; navigate to the issues settings; navigate to the <b>Custom fields</b> section under the <b>Fields</b> section; in the <b>Name</b> column, search for the custom field that the user wants to be added in the asset configuration parameter <b>custom_fields</b></li>
					</ul>
				<li>Cloud JIRA</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The timezone parameter here is the system settings timezone of the JIRA instance</li>
						<li>For checking the system settings timezone, navigate to the JIRA instance; navigate to the option <b>Jira Settings --> System</b> in the settings page; the value of the <b>Default user time zone</b> parameter is the timezone that has to be provided in the Phantom asset configuration</li>
					</ul>
			</ol>
			<li>If there is any error while fetching the custom fields metadata due to project configuration or lack of permissions, then, the custom fields will be ignored and the ingestion based on the system fields of the tickets (issues) will be executed successfully</li>
			<br>
			<li>Two approaches for fetching offenses</li>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Manual polling</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Fetch the tickets</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The tickets will be fetched from the project mentioned in the <b>Project key to ingest tickets (issues) from</b> app configuration parameter</li>
							<li>The tickets will be fetched in the oldest first order based on the <b>updated</b> time and governed by the <b>container_count</b> parameter in the On Poll action</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Fetch the components</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Fetch all created or updated components (e.g. fields, comments, and attachments) for each ticket (retrieved in the previous step)</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Create containers for the tickets and artifacts for the fields, comments, and the attachments</li>
						<li>It is recommended to provide a sufficiently large value in the <b>container_count</b> parameter for polling because manual polling does not remember the timestamp of last fetched ticket and it starts polling from the beginning every time. Hence, if the user runs the manual polling with e.g. 10 as the container count (the tickets are ingested successfully), then, the user again runs the manual polling with the same value in the container count; the app will fetch the same 10 tickets from the beginning and it will display the message as 'duplicate artifacts found' because the same artifacts were already ingested in the earlier manual polling run.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<li>Scheduled Polling</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Follows the same steps as manual polling with the below-mentioned points getting considered</li>
						<li>The application will fetch the number of tickets governed by the <b>Maximum tickets (issues) for scheduled polling</b> parameter (default: 100) in the On Poll action, whose <b>updated</b> time is greater than or equal to one minute less than the time stored in the <b>last_time</b> variable in the state file. The reason for reducing one minute from the <b>last_time</b> is to ensure that no tickets created or updated on the same minute are not getting skipped due to the granularity of Jira being 1 minute for the time-based filtering of the tickets.</li>
						<li>If the <b>last_time</b> variable is not present in the state file i.e. the On Poll is executing for the first time, the application will fetch the last <b>M</b> tickets (<b>M:</b> Value provided in the <b>Maximum tickets (issues) to poll first time</b> app configuration parameter (default: 100)) and then, from the next consecutive runs, it will fetch <b>N</b> tickets (<b>N:</b> Value provided in the <b>Maximum tickets (issues) for scheduled polling</b> app configuration parameter (default: 100)).</li>
						<li>The last_time will be updated by the <b>updated</b> time of the last ticket which was ingested</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<br>
		</ul>
   </ul>
</p>

<p><b>Some example caveats</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Attempting to set both Status and Resolution fails because the process set by the user doesn't require a resolution to be set by the user, such as if there is only one resolution for a particular status.</li>

		<li>Attempting to add a comment while setting Status may return success, however, the comment isn't posted.  In this case, when the status change is made via the Jira UI, no dialogue appears to offer any additional input, therefore the API expects the same.</li>

		<li>The "simple" format for the update ticket may not work to add a comment, while the "update" method does.</li>

		<li>Test connectivity may fail due to invalid credentials, such as accidentally using the user's email address as the authentication login instead of the user's login name.</li>

		<li>While adding an attachment to the Jira ticket using 'Update ticket' action, if the filename contains Unicode characters, the action is getting failed with the 500 Internal Server Error because of the Jira SDK issue. Due to this, action behaves differently with the various Phantom platforms. As a result, we have deployed the below-mentioned workflow which will ensure a minimal change in the filename and minimal/no data loss.
			<ol>
				<li>
					For the first time we try to add an attachment to the Jira ticket with the same name as the filename, if it may get successful, then it will add an attachment with the same name
				</li>
				<li>
					But if it fails, then, we will check whether there are Unicode characters or not in the filename, if it has, there are highly possible chances that Jira SDK might get throws an exception due to these Unicode characters.
				</li>
				<li>
					And in such a case, we removed those non-ASCII Unicode characters from the filename and add prefix FILENAME_ASCII to the filename. And, we again try to add an attachment with a newly created name to the Jira ticket.
				</li>
				<li>
					If it passes, then it's okay and if it doesn't, then, there might be some other genuine issue rather than the SDK issue and we fail the action by rethrowing the same error.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ul>
