<p>JIRA is a highly configurable ticketing system, and the actions performed by these API calls are highly dependent on the process defined in each Jira instance.</p>

<p>If your action fails, you may need to try an alternate method, or sequence, to perform the actions desired for Jira to process them properly.
One helpful debugging tool: simplify your action, instead of filling out all the fields, attempt to make only one change at a time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the JIRA API in most cases returns a generic error message with no valuable information to assist in debugging.</p>

	<b>Authentication steps for JIRA Cloud</b>
    <ul>
			<li>Create an API token</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Log in to <a href='https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens' target='_blank'>Click here.</a></li>
						<li>Click <b>Create API token.</b></li>
						<li>From the dialog that appears, enter a unique and concise <b>Label</b> for your token and click <b>Create</b>.</li>
						<li>Click <b>Copy to clipboard</b>, then paste the token to your script, or elsewhere to save.</li>
						<br>
						Notes:
							<li>For security reasons it isn't possible to view the token after closing the creation dialog; if necessary, create a new token.</li>
							<li>You should store the token securely, just as for any password.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
			<li>Use an API token</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A primary use case for API tokens is to allow scripts to access REST APIs for Atlassian Cloud applications using HTTP basic authentication.</li>
						<li>HTTP basic authentication would require a username and API token to access REST APIs for Atlassian Cloud applications.
					</ul>

		</ul>

	<b>Functioning of On Poll</b>
		<ul>
			<li>The On Poll action works in 2 steps. In the first step, all the tickets (issues) in a defined time duration will be fetched. In the second step, all the components (e.g. fields, comments, and attachments) of the tickets (retrieved in the first step) will be fetched. A container will be created for each ticket and for each ticket all the components will be created as the respective artifacts.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Two approaches for fetching offenses</li>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Manual polling</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Fetch the tickets</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The tickets will be fetched from the project mentioned in the <b>Project key to ingest tickets (issues) from</b> app configuration parameter</li>
							<li>Fetch the tickets with the number governed by the <b>container_count</b> parameter in the On Poll action</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Fetch the components</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Fetch all created or updated components (e.g. fields, comments, and attachments) for each ticket (retrieved in the previous step)</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Create containers for the tickets and artifacts for the fields, comments, and the attachments</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<li>Scheduled Polling</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Follows the same steps as manual polling with the below-mentioned points getting considered</li>
						<li>The application will fetch the number of tickets governed by the <b>Maximum tickets (issues) for scheduled polling</b> parameter in the On Poll action, whose <b>updated</b> time is greater than or equal to one minute less than the time stored in the <b>last_time</b> variable in the state file. The reason of reducing one minute from the <b>last_time</b> is to ensure that no tickets created or updated on the same minute are not getting skipped due to the granularity of Jira being 1 minute for the time-based filtering of the tickets.</li>
						<li>If the <b>last_time</b> variable is not present in the state file i.e. the On Poll is executing for the first time, the application will fetch the last <b>M</b> tickets (<b>M:</b> Value provided in the <b>Maximum tickets (issues) to poll first time</b> app configuration parameter) and then, from the next consecutive runs, it will fetch <b>N</b> tickets (<b>N:</b> Value provided in the <b>Maximum tickets (issues) for scheduled polling</b> app configuration parameter).</li>
						<li>The last_time will be updated by the <b>updated</b> time of the last ticket which was ingested</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<li>General Points for Polling</li>
					<ul>
						<li>User can provide the comma-separated display names of the custom fields (to be considered for the ingestion) in the asset configuration parameter <b>custom_fields</b> e.g. test_cf_1,test_cf_2 </li>
						<li>If there is any error while fetching the custom fields metadata due to project configuration or lack of permissions, then, the custom fields will be ignored and the ingestion based on the system fields of the tickets (issues) will be executed successfully</li>
						<li>The updated timestamps of the components have been appended to the end of the artifact name to maintain the uniqueness of a particular component</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<br>
		</ul>
   </ul>
</p>


<p>Some example caveats:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Attempting to set both Status and Resolution fails because the process set by the user doesn't require a resolution to be set by the user, such as if there is only one resolution for a particular status.</li>

		<li>Attempting to add a comment while setting Status may return success, however, the comment isn't posted.  In this case, when the status change is made via the Jira UI, no dialogue appears to offer any additional input, therefore the API expects the same.</li>

		<li>The "simple" format for the update ticket may not work to add a comment, while the "update" method does.</li>

		<li>Test connectivity may fail due to invalid credentials, such as accidentally using the user's email address as the authentication login instead of the user's login name.</li>
	</ul>
