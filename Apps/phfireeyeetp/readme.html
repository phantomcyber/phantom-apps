    <b>Actions</b>
    <p>
      It is important to know that all the actions in this app take affect on the Fireeye ETP side, with the exception of <i>remediating email</i>. For example, deleting a quarantined
      email is the action that deletes the email in the Fireeye ETP quarantined section, not in the Office365. Office365 may have other actions for quarantined emails from there own security suite 
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Remediate Email action</i>
      <p>
        This action talks to the API for Office365 which will move/delete the email depending on the input from the user. This action does not have an undo function and if the user selects action_overrite
        of delete, this email will be permanently deleted in the Office365 environment and not recoverable. Use cautiously!
