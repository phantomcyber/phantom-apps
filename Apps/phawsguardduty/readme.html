<p><b>On Poll Guidelines</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Configuration Parameters</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The asset configuration parameter poll_now_days is optional, with default value of 30 days. This configuration parameter is used for the manual polling using Poll Now.</li>
                <li>The asset configuration parameter filter_name is optional and if not specified, it will fetch all the findings. This configuration parameter is used in all the On Poll modes (manual polling, scheduled polling, and interval polling).</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Manual Polling</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Manual polling will fetch all the findings (in latest first order) based on the given filter_name (if filter_name is not provided, all findings will be fetched) for the last poll_now_days from the current time (if poll_now_days is not specified, default 30 days will be considered)</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Scheduled|Interval Polling</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The scheduled|interval polling fetches the findings (in oldest first order to ensure zero data loss) based on the same logic of the manual polling for the first run. The updatedAt time of the last fetched finding gets stored in this first run.</li>
                <li>For the consecutive runs, the findings get fetched after the stored updatedAt time in the previous run</li>
                <li>If the filter_name gets changed at an intermediate stage of the scheduled|interval polling, the next run of polling will auto-detect the change and it will poll the findings and reset the updatedAt time based on the new filter_name</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Recommendations for Filter Creation on AWS GuadrDuty UI</li>
            <ul>
                <li>For the On Poll action, it is not recommended to include upadetedAt (time based) filter criteria in the filter created on AWS GuardDuty UI to avoid conflicts with the timing logic of On Poll action</li>
                <li>If updatedAt (time based) filter criteria is included in the filter created on AWS GuardDuty UI, it will be explicitly replaced with the timing logic of the On Poll action <b>(keeping other filter criteria the same)</b></li>
            </ul>
    </ul>
