    <h1>Authentication</h1>
    All requests must be authenticated with a bearer token. Use the HTTP header Authorization with the value Bearer {token}. If the token is absent or invalid, Terraform Cloud responds with HTTP status 401 and a JSON API error object. The 401 status code is reserved for problems with the authentication token; forbidden requests with a valid token result in a 404.
    
    There are three kinds of token available:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>User tokens</b> — each Terraform Cloud user can have any number of API tokens, which can make requests on their behalf.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Team tokens</b> — each team can have one API token at a time. This is intended for performing plans and applies via a CI/CD pipeline.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Organization tokens</b> — each organization can have one API token at a time. This is intended for automating the management of teams, team membership, and workspaces. The organization token cannot perform plans and applies
        </li>
    </ul>
