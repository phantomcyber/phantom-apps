The **SlashNext Phishing Incident Response** Integration app allows Phantom users to fully automate
the analysis of suspicious URLs in phishing emails, network logs, and more. Playbooks that require
URL or Domain analysis can automatically analyze them with the **SlashNext SEER™** threat detection
cloud to get definitive, binary verdicts (malicious or benign) along with IOCs, screenshots, and
more. For example, IR teams responsible for abuse inbox management can extract links or domains out
of suspicious emails and automatically analyze them with the **SlashNext SEER™** threat detection
cloud to get definitive, binary verdicts (malicious or benign) along with IOCs, screenshots, and
more. Automating URL analysis can save IR teams hundreds of hours versus manually triaging these
emails or checking URLs and domains against less accurate phishing databases and domain reputation
services.  
SlashNext threat detection uses browsers in a purpose-built cloud to dynamically inspect page
contents and site behavior in real-time. This method enables SlashNext to follow URL re-directs and
multi-stage attacks to more thoroughly analyze the final page(s) and made a much more accurate,
binary determination with near-zero false positives. It also detects all six major categories of
phishing and social engineering sites. These include credential stealing, rogue software/malware
sites, scareware, phishing exploits (sites hosting weaponized documents, etc.), and social
engineering scams (fake deals, giveaways, etc.).  
Use cases include abuse inbox management where SOC teams can automate URL analysis in phishing
emails to save hundreds of hours versus more manual methods. Playbooks that mine and analyze network
logs can also leverage SlashNext URL analysis on demand.  
SlashNext not only provides accurate, binary verdicts (rather than threat scores), it provides IOC
metadata and screenshots of detected phishing pages. These enable easier classification and
reporting. Screenshots can be used as an aid in on-going employee phishing awareness training and
testing.  
The SlashNext Phishing Incident Response integration app uses an API key to authenticate with the
SlashNext cloud. If you don't have a valid API key, contact the SlashNext team:
