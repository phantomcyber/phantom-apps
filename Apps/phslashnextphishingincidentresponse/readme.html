      <br>The <b>SlashNext Phishing Incident Response</b> Integration app allows
    Phantom users to fully automate the analysis of suspicious URLs in phishing emails,
    network logs, and more. Playbooks that require URL or Domain analysis can automatically
    analyze them with the <b>SlashNext SEER™</b> threat detection cloud to get definitive,
    binary verdicts (malicious or benign) along with IOCs, screenshots, and more.</br>

    <br>SlashNext threat detection uses browsers in a purpose-built cloud to dynamically inspect page
    contents and site behavior in real-time. This method enables SlashNext to follow
    URL re-directs and multi-stage attacks to more thoroughly analyze the final page(s)
    and made a much more accurate, binary determination with near-zero false positives.
    It also detects all six major categories of phishing and social engineering sites.
    These include credential stealing, rogue software/malware sites, scareware, phishing
    exploits (sites hosting weaponized documents, etc.), and social engineering scams
    (fake deals, giveaways, etc.).</br>

      <br>Use cases include abuse inbox management where SOC teams can automate URL analysis in
    phishing emails to save hundreds of hours versus more manual methods. Playbooks that mine and
    analyze network logs can also leverage SlashNext URL analysis on demand.</br>

      <br>SlashNext not only provides accurate, binary verdicts (rather than threat scores),
    it provides IOC metadata and screenshots of detected phishing pages. These enable easier
    classification and reporting. Screenshots can be used as an aid in on-going employee
    phishing awareness training and testing. </br>

      <br>The SlashNext Phishing Incident Response integration app uses an API key to authenticate
      with the SlashNext cloud. If you don't have a valid API key, contact the SlashNext
      team: support@slashnext.com </br>
