<p>
Without additional configuration on the proxy server, it will not be possible to connect to WinRM using NTLM authentication through an HTTP(S) proxy.
If authentication is set to basic, then it will still work, however.
</p>
<p>
In order to use this app you must have the Windows Remote Management service running on the endpoint you wish to connect to.
For help regarding this process, consult this link: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384372(v=vs.85).aspx">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384372(v=vs.85).aspx</a>

<p>
The protocol and port can be specified with the IP/hostname. For example, if using HTTPS on port 5986, the IP/Hostname should be <b>https://192.168.10.21:5986</b>.
</p>
<p>
In the configuration options for the asset, a default protocol and port for actions can be specified.
These options will be prepended or appended to the IP/hostname provided for all actions including <b>test connectivity</b>.
If a different protocol or port number is specified in the IP/hostname field, the corresponding default will be ignored.
</p>
<p>
This app supports adding a custom parser for the actions <b>run script</b> and <b>run command</b>.
By default, the output of these actions will just be the status code, standard out, and standard error of
whatever gets ran. If you want to capture a specific string or fail on a certain status code, you will need
to provide a custom parser.
</p>
<p>
The custom parser should be a file added to the vault containing a function named <b>custom_parser</b>.
</p>
<pre class="shell">
<code>
import phantom.app as phantom


def custom_parser(action_result, response):
    # type: (ActionResult, winrm.Response) -> bool
    data = {}
    data['status_code'] = response.status_code
    data['std_out'] = response.std_out
    data['std_err'] = response.std_err

    action_result.add_data(data)
    return phantom.APP_SUCCESS
</code>
</pre>
<p>
This is equivalent to the default parser which is used if nothing is provided. It takes in an ActionResult and
a Response object (from the pywinrm module), and it is expected to return a boolean value
(phantom.APP_SUCCESS and phantom.APP_ERROR are equivalent to True and False).
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of a parser which will extract all the IPs from the output, and fail if there
is a non-zero status code.
</p>
<pre class="shell">
<code>
import re
import phantom.app as phantom
from phantom import utils as ph_utils


def custom_parser(action_result, response):
    # type: (ActionResult, winrm.Response) -> bool
    data = {}
    data['status_code'] = response.status_code
    data['std_out'] = response.std_out
    data['std_err'] =  response.std_err

    if data['status_code'] != 0:
        # This will be the message displayed
        return action_result.set_status(
            phantom.APP_ERROR, "Error: Returned a non-zero status code"
        )

    # This can still return values like 999.999.999.999
    ips = re.findall(r'\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}', data['std_out'])
    # Get only valid IPs
    filtered_ips = []
    for ip in ips:
        if ph_utils.is_ip(ip):
            filtered_ips.append(ip)

    data['ips'] = filtered_ips

    action_result.add_data(data)
    return phantom.APP_SUCCESS
</code>
</pre>
<p>
As a final thing to consider, the playbook editor will not be aware of any custom data paths
which your parser introduces.
Using the above example, if you wanted to use the list of ips in a playbook, you would need to type in the correct
datapath manually (action_result.data.*.ips).
</p>
<p>
For more information on datapaths and the ActionResult object, refer to the Phantom App Developer Guide.
</p>
<p>
Both the <b>run script</b> and <b>run command</b> actions also support running commands asynchronously.
By default, the app will wait for these actions to finish. In the case of starting a long running job,
or some other command which you want to start but don't care for the output, then you can check the <b>async</b> parameter.
After the command starts, it will return a <b>command_id</b> and <b>shell_id</b>, which you can optionally use to retrieve the
output of that command at a later time.
</p>
