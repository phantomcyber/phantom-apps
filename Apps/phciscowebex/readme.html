<h2>Authentication</h2>
This app supports two types of authentication:
<ul>
    <li>Using the Personal Access Token</li>
    <li>OAuth authentication</li>
</ul>
<h3>Using the Personal Access Token</h3>
To use this method navigate to <a href="https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/getting-started">developer site</a> in a browser and log in with your credentials. Copy the token and paste it into the <b>Personal Access Token</b> field in asset configuration. Click save and run test connectivity.
<br><br>

<h3>OAuth authentication</h3>
To enable OAuth and to retrieve Client ID and Client Secret, we need to follow the steps which are mentioned in the <a href="https://developer.webex.com/docs/integrations">developer document</a>. </li>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Steps</b>
    <ol>
      <li>Log in to the <a href="https://developer.webex.com/my-apps" target="_blank">Cisco Webex app page</a>.</li>
      <li>Click "Create a New App" then "Create an Integration" to start the wizard.</li>
      <li>You'll need to provide some basic information like your integration's name, description, and logo.</li>
      <li>After successful registration, you'll be taken to a different screen containing your integration's newly created Client ID and Client Secret.</li>
      <li>The Client Secret will only be shown once so please copy and keep it safe!</li>
      <li>Give the required scope which defines the level of access that your integration requires. </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
While creating the asset for this authentication method, provide the Client ID and Client Secret generated during previous steps in <b>client_id</b> and <b>client_secret</b> field of asset configuration and click on Save.
<br>
A new field called <b>POST incoming for Cisco Webex to this location</b> will appear in the <b>Asset Settings</b> tab. Take the URL found in this field and place it in the <b>Redirect URI(s)</b> field of your registered app. To this URL, add <b>/result</b> at the end. After doing so the URL should look something like:
<p>
  https://&lt;phantom_host&gt;/rest/handler/ciscowebex_34624d1a-f0ae-47d6-a731-8499d5617cf7/&lt;asset_name&gt;/result
</p>

<h2>Method to run Test Connectivity</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Using the Personal Access Token</b>
    <ul>
      <li>For the Personal Access Token method of authentication, you just need to click the TEST CONNECTIVITY button.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>OAuth authentication</b>
    <ul>
      <li>After setting up the asset, click the 'TEST CONNECTIVITY' button. A pop-up window will be displayed with appropriate test connectivity logs. It will also display a specific URL on that pop-up window.</li>
          <li>Open this URL in a separate browser tab. This new tab will redirect to the Cisco Webex login page to complete the login process to grant the permissions to the app.</li>
          <li>Log in using the same Cisco Webex account that was used to configure the integration and the application on the Cisco Webex page.</li>
          <li>This will display a successful message of 'Code received. Please close this window, the action will continue to get new token.' on the browser tab.</li>
          <li>Finally, close the browser tab and come back to the 'Test Connectivity' browser tab. The pop-up window should display a 'Test Connectivity Passed' message.</li>
        </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Explanation of Test Connectivity Workflow for Interactive auth</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>This app uses (version 1.0) OAUTH 2.0 authorization code workflow APIs for generating the [access_token] and [refresh_token] pairs if the authentication method is interactive else [Personal access token] if the authentication method is non-interactive is used for all the API calls to the Cisco Webex instance.</li>
          <li>An interactive authentication mechanism is a user-context-based workflow and the permissions of the user also matter along with the API permissions set to define the scope and permissions of the generated tokens. For more information visit the link mentioned here for the <a href="https://developer.webex.com/docs/integrations" target="_blank">OAUTH 2.0 AUTH CODE</a>.</li>
          <li>The step-by-step process for the entire authentication mechanism is explained below.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The first step is to get an application created on the Cisco Webex developer portal. Generate the [client_secret] for the configured application. The detailed steps have been mentioned in the earlier section.</li>
              <li>Run the test connectivity action for the Interactive method.</li>
              <ul>
				<li>Configure the Cisco Webex app's asset with appropriate values for [client_id] and [client_secret] configuration parameters.</li>
                <li>Internally, the connectivity creates a URL for hitting the /v1/authorize endpoint for the generation of the authorization code and displays it on the connectivity pop-up window. The user is requested to hit this URL in a browser new tab and complete the authorization request successfully resulting in the generation of an authorization code.</li>
                <li>The authorization code generated in the above step is used by the connectivity to make the next API call to generate the [access_token] and [refresh_token] pair. The generated authorization code, [access_token], and [refresh_token] are stored in the state file of the app on the Phantom server.</li>
                <li>The authorization code can be used only once to generate the pair of [access_token] and [refresh_token]. If the [access_token] expires, then the [refresh_token] is used internally automatically by the application to re-generate the [access_token] by making the corresponding API call. This entire autonomous workflow will seamlessly work until the [refresh_token] does not get expired. Once the [refresh_token] expires, the user will have to run the test connectivity action once again to generate the authorization code followed by the generation of an entirely fresh pair of [access_token] and [refresh_token].</li>
                <li>The successful run of the Test Connectivity ensures that a valid pair of [access_token] and [refresh_token] has been generated and stored in the app's state file. These tokens will be used in all the actions' execution flow to authorize their API calls to the Cisco Webex instance.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
        </ul>
      </p>

<h2>State file permissions</h2>
<p>
  Please check the permissions for the state file as mentioned below.
  <h4>State file path</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>For Non-NRI instance: /opt/phantom/local_data/app_states/&lt;appid&gt;/&lt;asset_id&gt;_state.json</li>
    <li>For NRI instance: /&lt;PHANTOM_HOME_DIRECTORY&gt;/local_data/app_states/&lt;appid&gt;/&lt;asset_id&gt;_state.json</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>State file permissions</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>File rights: rw-rw-r-- (664) (The phantom user should have read and write access for the state file)</li>
    <li>File owner: Appropriate phantom user</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>All the asset configuration parameters are optional, but you need to provide the configuration parameters based on the authentication method you want to use. Otherwise, the actions will return an error.</li>
    <li>The Personal Access Token is valid for only 12 hours.</li>
    <li>If you have provided all the configuration parameters, the priority of the authentication method will be Personal Access Token</li>
</ul>
<h4>The app is configured and ready to be used now.</h4>
