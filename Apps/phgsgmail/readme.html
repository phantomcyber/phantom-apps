    <h3>Service Account</h3>
    This app requires a pre-configured service account to operate. Please follow the procedure outlined at <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/7378726?hl=en">this link</a> to create a service account.<br>The following APIs will need to be enabled:<ul><li>AdminSDK</li><li>GMail API</li></ul> At the end of the creation process, the admin console should ask you to save the config as a JSON file. Copy the contents of the JSON file in the clipboard and paste it as the value of the <b>key_json</b> asset configuration parameter.
    <h3>Scopes</h3>
    Once the service account has been created and APIs enabled, the next step is to configure scopes on these APIs to allow the App to access them. Every action requires different scopes to operate, these are listed in the action documentation.<br>To enable scopes please complete the following steps:
    <ul>
   <li>Go to your G Suite domain's <a href="http://admin.google.com/">Admin console.</a></li>
   <li>Select <b>Security</b> from the list of controls. If you don't see <b>Security</b> listed, select <b>More controls</b> from the gray bar at the bottom of the page, then select <b>Security</b> from the list of controls. If you can't see the controls, make sure you're signed in as an administrator for the domain.</li>
    <li>Select <b>Show more</b> and then <b>Advanced settings</b> from the list of options.</li>
    <li>Select <b>Manage API client access</b> in the <b>Authentication</b> section.</li>
    <li>In the <b>Client Name</b> field enter the service account's <b>Client ID</b>. You can find your service account's client ID on the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/permissions/serviceaccounts">Service accounts page</a> or in the service account JSON file (key named <b>client_id</b>).</li>
    <li>In the <b>One or More API Scopes</b> field enter the list of scopes that you wish to grant access to the App. For example, to enable all the scopes required by this app enter: https://mail.google.com/, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly</li>
    <li>Click <b>Authorize</b>.</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>On-Poll</h3>
    <li>API provides created time of the email and gmail searches based on the received time of the email.</li><li> Use the large container numbers in asset to avoid any kind of data loss for emails which received at the same time.</li> <br>
    <br><b>Configuration:</b><br>
    <ul>
    <li>label - To fetch the emails from the given folder name (default - all folders). <br> <b>Note:- </b>  Reply email in the email thread would not be ingested if you provide a specific label in the configuration (eg.

    <li>ingest_manner - To select the oldest first or newest first preference for ingestion (default - oldest first).</li>
    <li>first_run_max_emails - Maximum containers to poll for the first scheduled polling (default - 1000).</li>
