<p>The app uses the tldextract python module, while executing the <b>domain reputation</b> action. This module uses the tld list from publicsuffix.org. The app ships with a tld list, however it will try to update the list the first time it runs and then try to update it at a regular interval. The interval is set in the app config.</p>
