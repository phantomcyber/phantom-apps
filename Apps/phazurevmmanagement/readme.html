  <ul>
    <li>For an admin user, you can run the test connectivity directly.
    <li>For a non-admin user, you need to get the admin consent first. This can be done by granting admin consent in the Azure portal.
  </ul>
  <h2>Authentication</h2>
  This app requires creating a Microsoft Graph Application. To do so, navigate to <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade">https://apps.dev.microsoft.com</a>
  in a browser and log in with a Microsoft account, then select <b>New registration</b>.
  <br><br>
  On the next page, give your application a name and select <b>Register</b>.
  <br><br>
  Once the app is created, three steps need to be taken on the next page:
  <br><br>
  Under <b>Certificates and Secrets</b>, select <b>New client secret</b>. Note this key somewhere secure, as it
  cannot be retrieved after closing the window.
  <br><br>
  <b>For Interactive OAuth</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Under <b>Authentication</b> select <b>Add a platform</b>. In the <b>Add a platform</b> window, select <b>Web</b>. The <b>Redirect
        URLs</b> should be filled right here. It should look somehting like: </li>
      <p>
        https://&lt;phantom_host&gt;/rest/handler/microsoftazurecompute_39c7128b-666b-4a16-9d44-afab6a9b825d/&lt;asset_name&gt;/result
      </p>
    <li>Under <b>API permissions</b> the following <b>Delegated Permissions</b> need to be added:
      <ul>
        <li>Group.ReadWrite.All</li>
        <li>offline_access</li>
        <li>User.ReadWrite.All</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
  <b>For Non-Interactive OAuth</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Under <b>API permissions</b> the following <b>Application Permissions</b> need to be added:
      <ul>
        <li>Group.ReadWrite.All</li>
        <li>User.ReadWrite.All</li>
      </ul>
    <li>On the Azure portal, go to subscriptions and select your subscription.</li>
    <li>Go to Access control(IAM) section and click on add role assignment.</li>
    <li>Select <b>Contributer</b> in the <b>Role</b> field from the drop down and select your application in the <b>Select</b> field.</li>
  </ul>
  After making these changes, click <b>Save</b> at the bottom of the screen.
  <h2>Configure the Microsoft Azure Compute Phantom app Asset</h2>
  When creating an asset for the <b>Microsoft Azure Compute</b> app, place <b>Subscription Id</b> of the app in the <b>Subscription ID</b> field,
  place <b>Application Id</b> of the app created during the previous step in the <b>Client ID</b> field,
  and place the password generated during the app creation process in the <b>Client Secret</b> field.
  Then, after filling out the <b>Tenant ID</b> field, click <b>SAVE</b>.
  <br><br>
  After saving, a new field will appear in the <b>Asset Settings</b> tab. Take the URL found in the <b>POST incoming
    for Microsoft Azure Compute to this location</b> field and place it in the <b>Redirect URLs</b> field mentioned in a
  previous step. To this URL, add <b>/result</b>. After doing so the URL should look something like:
  <br><br>
  <p>
    https://&lt;phantom_host&gt;/rest/handler/microsoftazurecompute_39c7128b-666b-4a16-9d44-afab6a9b825d/&lt;asset_name&gt;/result
    </p>
  <br>
  Once again, click save at the bottom of the screen.
  <h2>Method to run test connectivity</h2>
  After setting up the asset and user, click the <b>TEST CONNECTIVITY</b> button. A window should pop up and display a
  URL. Navigate to this URL in a separate browser tab. This new tab will redirect to a Microsoft login page. Log in to
  a Microsoft account. After logging in, review the requested permissions listed, then click <b>Accept</b>. Finally,
  close that tab. The test connectivity window should show a success.<br>
  If the admin consent is required then, the display url will occur twice. The first one will be for admin access.
  <br><br>
  The app should now be ready to be used.
  <h2>State file permissions</h2>

    Please check the permissions for the state file as mentioned below.
