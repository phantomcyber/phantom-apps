        <h2>Why Radar</h2>
        <p>Every day, organizations experience privacy and security incidents involving regulated data. Both privacy and security teams are challenged to keep up with ever-changing global data breach notification laws. Furthermore, these teams must efficiently and accurately determine which incidents require notification to regulators or customers based on a patchwork of increasingly complex data breach regulations. That’s why we created Radar.</p>
        <p>Organizations rely on Radar to reduce risk, save time and cost, and build trust by demonstrating a strong culture of compliance through a consistent and defensible incident response management process.</p>
        <h3>Incident Response Automation</h3>
        <p>Automation in incident response eliminates the subjectivity and inconsistency that is inherent in manual approaches. Leveraging technology ensures consistency, accelerates the decision-making process, and eliminates the risk of over- and under-notifying. </p>
        <h3>Reduce Risk</h3>
        <p>With a streamlined incident response process your organization can eliminate subjectivity with consistent incident risk scoring and our patented law engine that provides accurate data breach notification guidance.</p>
        <h3>Save Time & Cost</h3>
        <p>Radar will cut your team’s incident response efforts in half with our automated guidance based on state, federal, and global data breach notification regulations.</p>
        <h3>Build Trust</h3>
        <p>With Radar you can make accurate notification decisions every time and demonstrate a strong culture of compliance. Incident details, assessment results, notifications, and benchmarking data are easily accessible and stored in a central repository, meeting the needs of auditors, regulators, and senior management.</p>
