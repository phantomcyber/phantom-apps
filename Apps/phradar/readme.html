        <h2>Why Radar</h2>
        <p>Every day, organizations experience privacy and security incidents involving regulated data. Both privacy and security teams are not only challenged to keep up with ever-changing global data breach notification laws, but are required to respond quickly and accurately in order to meet their regulatory obligations. With a maze of increasingly complex global regulations - including New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA), and EUâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - the need to respond efficiently and within mandated timelines is paramount to reducing risk and eliminating the exposure to potential fines.</p>
        <p>With the Splunk Phantom Radar integration, Radar enables the efficient communication between security and privacy teams allowing a timely handoff of critical information while staying compliant, thus reducing the overall Mean Time To Privacy Risk Assessment (MTTPRA). When security investigates a case and learns that the incident involves regulated data, security, using manual actions or Playbooks, can send incident information  to their privacy counterparts via the Radar SaaS platform.</p>
        <p>With the advent of a mandatory reporting window of just 72 hours with GDPR, regardless of a completed security investigation, the early involvement of privacy leads to increased efficiency and the ability to meet aggressive notification deadlines.</p>

        <h3>Incident Response Automation</h3>
        <p>Automation in incident response eliminates the subjectivity and inconsistency that is inherent in manual approaches. Radar provides a consistent approach to privacy incident response that promotes clear communication between the security and privacy teams and accelerates the decision-making process. This in turn eliminates the risk of over- and under-notification and helps your organization reduce risk, save time and cost, and build trust. </p>
