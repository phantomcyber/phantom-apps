Version 1.0.3
-------------
    - added 'contains' to the metadata given to the vault when adding a file
      (get file). Hence, vault files should have a 'contains' generated from
      the Analyzers sample_type.

Version 1.0.4
-------------
    - added summary.json to outputs of 'get report' and 'detonate file'.
    - added certain fields (i.e. extracted_files.*_hash, ip, norm_filename,
      url) of summary.json to the vmray.json and added appropriate contains
      markers.
